This pseudocode provides a high-level overview of a MongoDB transaction across multiple collections using GIN. 
It assumes that you have at least 10 different collections (collection1, collection2, etc.), 
and each collection has its corresponding MongoDB document model. 

1. Establish MongoDB connection and create a client.

2. Define the MongoDB configuration:
   - mongoURL = "mongodb://localhost:27017"
   - databaseName = "exampledb"
   - collection1 = "collection1"
   - collection2 = "collection2"
   - ... (add more collections as needed)

3. Define the Model structs representing the MongoDB documents for each collection.

4. Initialize a GIN router.

5. Define a GIN API endpoint ("/mongodb-transaction-api"):

   a. Start a MongoDB session.
   b. Defer ending the MongoDB session.
   c. Begin a MongoDB transaction using WithSession.

   d. Inside the transaction:
      - Access each collection using the session.
      - Perform operations on each collection (insert, update, delete, etc.).

   e. Check for errors during the transaction:
      - If an error occurs, respond with an HTTP 500 status and an error message.
      - If successful, respond with an HTTP 200 status and a success message.

6. Run the GIN router on port 8080.

7. Handle MongoDB disconnection during program termination.
